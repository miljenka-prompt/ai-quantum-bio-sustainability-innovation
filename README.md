## Abstract

QBioSys proposes a revolutionary framework for integrating quantum computing, AI, and biological systems to address key challenges in climate modeling, AI ethics, and resource optimization. The framework combines:
- **Quantum algorithms** for rapid processing of complex simulations
- **Biological sensors** as natural regulatory feedback loops
- **Ethical frameworks** based on distributed stochastic logic

## Disclaimer

All projects on this profile, including QBioSys, are prototypes developed primarily through advanced prompting techniques and intuitive vibe coding, without deep technical expertise or formal testing.  
They serve as compelling illustrations of how high-quality prompting and creative intuitive coding can generate innovative and potentially impactful solutions to complex problems, such as climate change prediction.

**Users should consider these projects experimental and untested. They are intended to inspire further research and development rather than serve as production-ready systems.**
