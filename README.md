## Purpose and Scope

**QBioSys** is an innovative open-source prototype that integrates quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biological feedback mechanisms. Its mission is to enable sustainable, ethical, and highly efficient computational solutions for complex challenges such as climate modeling, resource optimization, and AI safety.

- Accelerate climate simulations using quantum algorithms
- Incorporate biological sensors as natural feedback controllers
- Implement distributed, transparent ethical frameworks for AI
- Support research, prototyping, and real-world applications

## Abstract

QBioSys proposes a revolutionary framework for integrating quantum computing, AI, and biological systems to address key challenges in climate modeling, AI ethics, and resource optimization. The framework combines:
- **Quantum algorithms** for rapid processing of complex simulations
- **Biological sensors** as natural regulatory feedback loops
- **Ethical frameworks** based on distributed stochastic logic

## Disclaimer

All projects on this profile, including QBioSys, are prototypes developed primarily through advanced prompting techniques and intuitive vibe coding, without deep technical expertise or formal testing.  
They serve as compelling illustrations of how high-quality prompting and creative intuitive coding can generate innovative and potentially impactful solutions to complex problems, such as climate change prediction.

**Users should consider these projects experimental and untested. They are intended to inspire further research and development rather than serve as production-ready systems.**

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QBioSys.git
    cd QBioSys


    Here's the **minimal yet complete code integration** for your GitHub README, with clear explanations:

### Code Implementation
```python
# QBioSys Prototype: Quantum-Bio-AI with DAO Governance
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import numpy as np
import random

# 🌿 Biosensor Simulation
class BiosensorAPI:
    @staticmethod
    def get_ph_level():
        """Mock pH sensor data (6.0-8.0 range)"""
        return random.uniform(6.0, 8.0)

# ⚛️ Quantum Optimization
def quantum_optimize(ph):
    """1-qubit circuit with bio-feedback"""
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
    qc.ry(ph * 0.2 * np.pi, 0)  # pH-adjusted rotation
    result = execute(qc, Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')).result()
    return np.abs(result.get_statevector()[0]) ** 2 * 100  # Resource %

# 🏛️ DAO Governance (Simplified)
class QBioSysDAO:
    def __init__(self):
        self.proposals = []
    
    def vote(self, approve: bool):
        """Single-vote mock DAO"""
        return "APPROVED" if approve else "REJECTED"

# 🚀 Demo Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bio_data = {"ph": BiosensorAPI.get_ph_level()}
    allocation = quantum_optimize(bio_data["ph"])
    dao_decision = QBioSysDAO().vote(allocation > 30)
    print(f"Allocation: {allocation:.1f}% | DAO: {dao_decision}")
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Biosensor Mock** - Simulates pH data (replace with real API calls)
2. **Quantum Core** - 1-qubit circuit dynamically adjusted by sensor data
3. **DAO Logic** - Basic approval mechanism for resource allocation

**Expandable Architecture:**
- Add more qubits with `QuantumCircuit(2)`
- Integrate real sensors via `requests.get()`
- Extend DAO with `web3.py` for blockchain


### Why This Works:
1. **Clean Integration** - Maintains all key concepts from your original code
2. **Zero Dependencies** - Only requires `qiskit` and `numpy`
3. **Clear Pathways** - Comments show where to add real-world components


    ```
2. **Install requirements:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run a demo:**
    ```
    python src/demo.py
    ```
